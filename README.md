# Image Steganography in Python
<b>Steganography</b>: is the practice of concealing a file, message, image or video inside the other file, message, image or video.<br>
The first recorded use of steganography was in 1499 by johannes Trithemius.<br>
In Steganography, generally the hidden message appears to be something else: image, article or some other cover text.<br>
For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink on a blank paper or between the lines of a private letter.<br>
Advantage of Steganography over Cryptography is that the intended message doesn't attract attention to itself.<br>

I have implemented Image Steganography using Least Significant Bit(LSB) method.<br>

To complete this task I have used 3 libraries:<br>

1.PIL - Pillow library to work with Images in Python
2.os - to get the size of image
3.shutil - to cpy the image

If you don't have PIL librrary the open your command prompt or Anaconda prompt and type: pip install Pillow,<br>
